### Project Description:
This project contains the code that takes input from sensors and operates motor drivers and led signals sent through two STM 32 boards. One of the boards acts as the controller while the other acts as the receiver on the rover.


### Technologies Used:
- STM 32 Nucleo Board
- MQ 135 Air Quality
- LM335Z Temperature Sensor
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- L293D Motor Driver Chip

### Other Materials:
- DC Motor 9V
- ECA-0JHG102 1000 µF Capacitor
- GRM188R60J / 226MEA0J 1 µF Capacitor
- RC0402FR-07 100RL 100 Ohm Resistor
- Red LED
- Terminal Block
